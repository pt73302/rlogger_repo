UPDATE: currently developing with Eclipse is broken,
du to changes made for android wear. Patches that restores
eclipse but keeps android wear structure is welcome.

If you want to use Eclipse instead of Android Studio, follow these steps:

	1. Set $ANDROID_HOME env variable to your Android SDK folder path.

	2. Run the following command to get all submodules:

		git submodule init && git submodule update

	3. Download required .jar libraries in libs/ subfolder:

	* Copy $ANDROID_HOME/extras/android/support/v4/android-support-v4.jar

	* Download https://github.com/fishkingsin/BLEDialogTool/raw/master/lib/samsung_ble_sdk_200.jar to external/

	* Download https://github.com/ant-wireless/Android_API_ANTPlus/raw/master/antpluginlib_2.0.0.jar to external/

	If any other .jar is missing, search the associated sourceUrl the build.gradle file which is used in Android Studio to download dependencies.

	4. Open the android SDK and download Extras -> Google Play services

	5. Copy $ANDROID_HOME/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/google-play-services_lib in the same folder than RunnerUp, or update project.properties.
	Change line:

		android.library.reference.1=../../google-play-services_lib

	By the relative path of the google-play-services_lib.

	Do NOT use absolute path since this is not supported on Unix like OS (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18209041/how-to-define-v7-appcompat-dependency-correctly)

	6. Press on the play button and the project should compile and deploy to your device!
